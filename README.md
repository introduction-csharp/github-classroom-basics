# Github Classroom Basics

This task is designed to help us all get to grips with using GitHub Classroom, which is a means for you to be able to write your code and then submit it to me easily. 

In addition to discussing it in class I have compiled a basic [HOWTO connect to GitHub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H5TFTpSEZ8EY8EkjShkxyZCBr6sT1Y7F0CYfI9q-OFM/edit?usp=sharing) document which might help you to do the basics. 

## Task 1

For this assignment, simply create a C# solution to ask the use for an integer and return that number doubled. 

Then upload the answer to this repo. 

## Task 2 

Also commit your half term cheatsheet.
